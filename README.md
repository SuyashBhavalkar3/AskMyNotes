# AskMyNotes

This repository contains the backend API for the AskMyNotes application. The service is built with FastAPI and provides user authentication as well as a user profile feature where each user can store three subject names.

## Available endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/register` – register a new user (name, email, password).
- `POST /auth/login` – obtain a JWT token by providing email and password.
- `GET /auth/me` – retrieve information about the currently authenticated user.

### Profile
- `POST /profile/` – create or update the current user's profile. The payload must include exactly three subjects:
  ```json
  {
      "subject1": "Mathematics",
      "subject2": "Physics",
      "subject3": "Chemistry"
  }
  ```
- `GET /profile/` – fetch the current user's profile (requires valid JWT in Authorization header).

API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI and available at `/docs` when the server is running.
